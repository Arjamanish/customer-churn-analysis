# Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn behavior in a telecom company and builds a machine learning model to predict customers likely to leave. The goal is to identify churn drivers and provide actionable business insights.

## 🧠 Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Identify key churn factors
- Build churn prediction model using Logistic Regression
- Use SQL for business analytics
- Provide retention recommendations

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- SQL (SQLite / MySQL)
- Google Colab
- GitHub
